This application allows users to create a drawing and manipulate the image by mirroring it to create a tessallation.

Iteration #2 IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

We exhausted our resources and knowledge when attempting to unit test "OnDraw" methods. We were unable to create a rule 
with the onDraw class as the parameter due to the class not being extended to AppCompactActivity, unlike the other unit tests.
Additional comments are located in the OnDrawTest.java
